#### 2) View functions
##### users/routes.py

##### siteview/routes.py

- ~~index (home page)~~
- ~~search_results~~

#### 2) Misc

- Change search functionality to look for users that have a similar username to the search instead of the exact name
- Add default profile picture for new users
- Setup Replit for deployment
- Maybe the likes / hearts system + friending system
- Implement the two new Python libraries (Plotly, NetworkX(?))
  - Maybe consider switching to a simpler library like Flask-Mail
- ~~- Security with Flask Talisman~~
