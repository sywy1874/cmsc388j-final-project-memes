  This website was created for sharing memes. Once registered, users can log in
  to post their own memes to the site. Memes will be assigned a category
  representing meme types (such as wholesome, surreal,
  shitpost, etc). Some features include a commenting system, searching for memes,
  searching for users, looking at your account stats (plotly). When searching for a user, 
  they can see all the posts that the former has made. Additionally using flask_mail a welcome 
  email is sent to the user when they register!
